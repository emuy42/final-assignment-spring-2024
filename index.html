        <p>From stone-flanked quads to concrete urban centers, university students took over campus spaces to make various demands related to the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Some students left with an amount of victory: commitments to financial transparency and scholarships, cultural centers and public statements. The majority left with nothing. We analyzed protests across the U.S. to ask: what led to successful agreements?</p>
<br>
        <p>After finding an unattributed, activist-generated list of universities online, we verified encampments at almost 110 campuses. Our team also searched for encampments not found on this unofficial collection. We included every school that had students who participated in a protest that began by April 30th and was described as having “tents” or as an “encampment,” or in which the reporter wrote they “camped out.” We relied overwhelmingly on the journalists at campus newspapers, leaning on local and occasionally national coverage when answers were not immediately forthcoming.</p>
        <p>Demonstrators and administrators who shared mutual agreements exhibited some behaviors emphasized by conflict resolution experts. Those traits included: leveraging opportunities, compromising on issues in service of interests, and working to minimize inaction. After a tumultuous spring, 16% of the studied encampments ended in a successful negotiation.</p>
<br></br>

        <p>On the 56% of campuses that experienced arrests, an average of 45 people were detained. Larger schools were less likely to have a successful negotiation. New York City’s Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) has a medium-sized population, but the police arrested more than average - 50 demonstrators, whose leadership had failed to come to an agreement with the administration. Gothamist reported that protesters were offered two concessions that were not part of their original demands (disclose investments, divest from Israeli companies, officially condemn the war). FIT administration would have provided a scholarship fund for Palestinian students and a prayer room for the school’s Muslim community. Both were demanded at other schools, but not FIT.</p>
        <p>“They truly do not hear our demands and don’t understand them,” Jeremy Noone, an FIT junior and organizer told Gothamist, “A lot of the time they’ll kind of just sweep them under the rug and try to offer other negotiations that are completely not what we’re asking for.” FIT student negotiators were not able to make headway before the police arrived at the end of their second week.</p>

<p>Dr. Dalal Iriqat, Associate Professor at Ramallah’s Arab American University, has trained in conflict resolution and leadership at Harvard and Stanford, respectively. She says that successful negotiations balance issues and interests. “In negotiations, we never negotiate over our interest,” Iriqat explains what is called the interest-vested school of negotiation, which focuses on the core tenants of the parties who “don't negotiate the interest, but rather negotiate the different positions that would definitely serve the interest at the end of the day.”</p>
<p>Campuses saw a wide variety of negotiation scenarios. In Chicago’s DePaul University, the administration repeatedly appealed to the divestment coalition for a meeting and was met with denials. In one exchange published on the school website, student demonstrators took more than 14 hours to respond to a request, with an expanding list of conditions for a discussion. Administrators offered two concessions (out of the organizers’ original 10) and responded, in writing, to all of the students’ demands.</p>
<br>
<p> The parties met again on the encampment’s 12th day, at which point the administration blamed the protesters for the negotiation breakdown. "It became apparent that the student leaders did not have the ability to represent everyone or make decisions in our final meeting with the DePaul Divestment Coalition and their attorney on May 11,” President Robert L. Manuel said in his statement.</p>
<p>Dr. Ran Kuttner, Associate Professor at Haifa University, helped direct Harvard Law School’s Dispute Resolution Project as its visiting scholar. He spoke about problems that can arise in extended negotiations. “Usually [negotiations] can easily get into stalemates if it takes a long time,” says Kuttner, “There should be a tempo here that can help leverage the situation without getting stuck. But, it depends on what kind of negotiations, so it's context-dependent as well.”</p>
<p>The size of schools’ undergraduate population mattered in our analysis. The largest student body that experienced a successful negotiation was roughly 40,000. The largest population that held no negotiations was three times that size.</p>
<br>
<p>Iriqat explained that negotiations depend on both the issue at hand and the relationships between parties discussing them. She went further, “The more the relationship matters, the more lenient, the more cooperative and collaborative the negotiating teams can go. The more the issue is more important than the relationship, then the more avoiding or competing.”</p>
<p>Anecdotally, we saw smaller campuses work with their protesters to experience peaceful encampments, regardless of the results of negotiations. St. Paul’s Hamline University, undergraduate population less than 2,000, let their local demonstration continue. Protesters still camped on the lawn when we cut off the data (May 10) and planned to temporarily move for commencement. This quiet action occurred after six students occupied the provost’s office on the encampment’s first night. In response, the interim provost spent the night as well, conversing with students. The openness surprised some long-time professors. Angela Pelster-Wiebe has taught creative writing at Hamline for almost nine years. She told the Hamline Oracle, “I’m not convinced anymore that just getting angry at the person you disagree with is gonna do the work that you want to do.”</p>

<p>Overwhelmingly, public schools prevailed (80% of all fruitful negotiations occurred at a public institute). The University of California at Riverside - a public institution with almost 23,000 undergraduates - experienced a deceptively speedy success. Immediately after their encampment was created, the administration acknowledged the legitimacy of protesters’ concerns before laying out terms of engagement in a public email. After their encampment’s fourth day, they published their shared agreement. With modifications, all the students’ demands were addressed.</p>
<br>
<p>Their lead negotiator, Samia Alkam, told The Highlander that the school’s desire to be seen as the “most diverse, most social justice-oriented, most progressive UC [University of California] gave negotiators leverage over the administration." Alkam left off another element: the previous seven months of unanswered letters and protests by their organization.</p>
<br>
<p>Kettner explains that, theoretically, “Usually the side that has less power is making sure to make things public…  trying to portray those in power as being illegitimate for putting the force that they put, kind of value-based argumentations.”</p>
<br>
<p>Kettner spoke to the NYC News Service while on the road in Israel. Iriqat WhatsApp’ed from the West Bank. We asked her about the importance of this analysis in light of ongoing, catastrophic events. “Negotiations is a field of study,” she replied, “A lifestyle and a tool that should be adopted in every kind of dispute - whether on the personal level, institutional level, state level or national level.” </p>
<br></br>
<h3>Methodology:</h3>
<p>We prioritized coverage from student-powered newspapers.
When demands were readily listed on the Instagram pages for campus organizations, we included those. If those demands or organizations were not available, we deferred to demands listed in local newspaper articles.</p>
<br>

<p>We defined “encampment” as a protest that was described with terms like “tents,” “encampment” and “camping out.” The start date of the encampment was determined by the earliest article we found mentioning it. The end date of the encampment proved somewhat more difficult - we anecdotally presume that some encampments petered out without a newsworthy conclusion. Otherwise, we used the dates of the arrest or official disbanding.</p>
<br>
<p>Included in our analysis were encampments that began before May 1st. Encampments still occurring on May 10th are listed as “ongoing” on the map.</p>
<br>
<p>“Failed negotiations” consist of documented occasions when protesters and administration met during the encampment, but did not result in a mutually-satisfactory conclusion. This was determined first by statements by school officials, then by campus newspapers when no other information was available. Many schools may have tried negotiations that they did not publicize.</p>
<br>
<p>School information - its undergraduate population, tuition, and location - were accessed by visiting school websites. If that was not immediately obvious, we used U.S. News & World Report data. Schools’ endowments were included in their financial statements. We used the most recent year available. In some cases, that year was 2018 but the bulk were reported for the years 2022-2023. </p>
<br>
<p>The statuses of states’ anti-BDS laws were found through news coverage or the website <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-bds-legislation" target="_blank" title="JewishVirtualLibrary">JewishVirtualLibrary</a>. The school encampment list was originally found via an unattributed source, forwarded amongst activists. We used that list as a base and confirmed its accuracy while searching news coverage for unlisted encampments.</p>
